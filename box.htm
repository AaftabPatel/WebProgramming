	<h1>Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya</h1><br>
	Devi Ahilya University (informally abbreviated DAVV),
	formerly Indore University, is a State University whose jurisdiction was initially restricted to Indore 
	city. Later on, its jurisdiction was extended to seven tribal-dominated districts of Indore division namely, Jhabua, Alirajpur, Dhar, Khargone, Khandwa, Burhanpur and Barwani. It is thus catering to the educational needs of the most industrially developed district of Madhya Pradesh, Indore on one hand and to the seven tribal and rural backward districts of the State on the other. 
	DAVV is the only University in Madhya Pradesh accredited A+ Grade by NAAC.
